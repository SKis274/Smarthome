## Environment
Homeassistant is running on a <a href="https://www.geekom.de/geekom-miniair-11?sscid=b1k6_2o5qt&">GEEKOM MiniAir11</a> as a bare-metal <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/generic-x86-64/">Generic x86-64 HAOS Installation</a>. It has a lot of power and enough ressources for planned extensions in the future.

In the past Homeassistant was installed as a VM in the virtual machine manager on a Synology DS218+ NAS. 

It also works fine but it takes a lot longer to load graphes and performance lacks occurs when running frigate addon!
